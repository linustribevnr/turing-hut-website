Greetings Juniors✨!<br/>
Turing Hut is excited to present its "**Competitive Programming workshop**"  exclusively for **first** years!

It's a Two - Day Workshop which will be hosted Online on the 9th & 10th of May, from 10 AM to 1 PM. We'll be introducing multiple competitive coding platforms and important concepts & algorithms to help you kick start your CP Journey.

The Workshop will be followed by a Practice Contest on the 10th May, from 3 PM to 5 PM. The purpose of the contest is to expose you to different types of problems and give you a contest experience.
The Leaderboard will not be taken into consideration.
This session will be a foundation for Coding fundamentals, so try to engage as much as possible.

**Open to all branches of VNRVJIET!**
