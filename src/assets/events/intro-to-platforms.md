Turing Hut is going to conduct a selection contest for 1st year CSE, CSBS students soon. Based on the contest, we will select some students for Turing Hut teaching sessions, where your seniors will teach you CP concepts and provide guidance.

Since many of you are having a problem using coding platforms, we are going to conduct a session where we will guide you on how to use the coding platforms and we will solve some problems, so that you will get an idea of problem solving. After the session, you will have around one week of time to practice after which you will have to attempt the contest. Since you are learning the basics of C language, the implementation of the problems in the contest will be limited to the concepts you have learnt so far.

**Agenda of the session:**

- How to use Hackerrank, Codechef, Codeforces
- Solving some problems from each of the above platforms
- How to start problem solving, for beginners
- General CP guidance
- Resources to learn concepts, and solve problems.
- Doubt clarification

**Speaker:** K. Yogendra Sai, 3rd year
