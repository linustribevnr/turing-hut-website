Are you waiting to take your first step in open source? Or want to build new projects to add to your portfolio?

Turing Hut brings to you **A Guided Path for MLH Fellowship**. MLH Fellowship is a fully remote, 12-week internship where participants earn a stipend and learn to collaborate on real open source projects with peers and engineers from top companies.

In this session, a past fellow will walk us through the application process, and share their tips for getting selected. We invite interested students from all branches and years to join in and explore this opportunity.
