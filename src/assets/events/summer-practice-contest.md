We, Turing Hut, the official Programming club from VNRVJIET are conducting a Practice Contest. It is just for your practice and we are not going to consider your scores or your rank in this contest so solve the problems honestly.

We will also be conducting a Selection Contest soon and based on your performance in the contest we will select some students who can attend the Turing Hut Teaching Sessions where your seniors will teach you various concepts related to competitive porgramming. So practice well for the contest
