The European Space Agency (ESA) successfully launched the Euclid space telescope on the 1st of July at 11:12 AM ET, aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from Florida's Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. The Euclid aims to capture high-resolution images of galaxies and map their distribution in order to better understand the accelerated expansion of the universe.
By studying elusive cosmic components, scientists hope to discover the secrets behind a significant portion of the universe... dark energy and dark matter. The launch of the Euclid signifies a milestone in the human quest to unravel the mysteries of our cosmos.
